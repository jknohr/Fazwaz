```rust

pub struct HistogramData {
pub channels: [Vec<u32>; 3], // RGB channels
pub luminance: Vec<u32>, // Combined luminance
pub total_pixels: u32
}
```

### Statistical Metrics

```rust
pub struct HistogramStats {
pub mean_brightness: f32,
pub contrast_ratio: f32,
pub dynamic_range: f32,
pub exposure_value: f32,
pub quality_score: f32
}
```

## Use Cases

### Real Estate Photography Validation
- Window exposure detection
- Interior lighting balance
- Architectural detail preservation
- Color cast identification

### Quality Control Pipeline
```rust
let stats = analyze_histogram(&image);
if !stats.meets_quality_thresholds() {
return Err(ImageValidationError::QualityBelowThreshold);
```
